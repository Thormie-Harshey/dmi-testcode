This repository is a part of the class I would be taking the students of the Build With Oyo (BWO) initiative.
These students are interested in DevOps, and I have been chosen as a facilitator for the program.
So, I have to teach them a simple deployment on Nginx, then we can talk about other concepts like Docker, and CICD.
